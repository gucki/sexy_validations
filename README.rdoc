=About

This gem provides sexy validations/ validators functionality for models. 
It was heavily inspired by the new validators in rails 3. Basically
it's a replacement for "inlcude ActiveModel::Validations", because those
are strangely complex and don't work together properly with sequel for
example.

==Install

Simply install it as any other gem:

  gem install sexy_validations

Or when using bundler, add it got your Gemfile:

  gem sexy_validations

==Quick Start

In your model:

  class User
    include SexyValidations

    validates :name, :presence => true, :length => 2..20
    validates :description, :length => 0..2000

    def valid?
      validate!
      errors.empty?
    end
  end

You can also pass a symbol, which will be used a a method name:

  class User
    validates :special

    def special_validation
      if 5 > 9
        errors.add(:boah, "ruby seems to be buggy....")
      end
    end
  end

And even a block is accepted

  class User
    validates do
      if 5 > 9
        errors.add(:boah, "ruby seems to be buggy....")
      end
    end
  end

==Additional sequel specific validators

Please have a look at my sequel_sexy_validations gem (depends on this one). 
This gem contains extra validators like Uniqueness.

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so we donâ€™t break anything in a future version unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
